        <h3>Thai-Cambodia conflict a challenge for Asean</h3>

            LESS than two weeks after a “peace agreement” supposedly brokered by US President Donald Trump between Thailand and Cambodia was signed, it has apparently fallen apart, with Thailand declaring it was “suspending” the deal after two of its soldiers were injured by a landmine in the disputed border area between the two countries. This unfortunate development presents a serious challenge to the Philippines as it takes on the leadership of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean) for 2026, but it also could serve as an opportunity to strengthen the regional alliance. 
        </p>

        <p>
            The border dispute between Thailand and Cambodia has lasted more than a century, and was sparked by the arbitrary redrawing of the border by the French after that country occupied Cambodia as a colony. Several important temples, which are significant to and claimed by both sides are located in the mountainous border region between northern Cambodia and the Thai provinces of Surin, Sisaket and Ubon Ratchathani. In late July, a serious outbreak of fighting between Thai and Cambodian forces saw airstrikes and cross-border artillery attacks, forcing an estimated 300,000 civilians on both sides to flee. Several dozen people, mostly civilians, were killed in the fighting, which capped off two months of growing tension between the two countries.

        <p>
            Largely without the intervention of outside parties, the two countries agreed to a ceasefire, and the agreement signed at the Asean summit in Kuala Lumpur late last month called for both sides to withdraw their heavy weapons from the region and to establish an interim observer team to monitor deescalation efforts. Neither Thailand nor Cambodia refers to the agreement as a “peace agreement”; it is instead called the “Joint Declaration by the prime ministers of Thailand and Cambodia on the outcomes of their meeting in Kuala Lumpur.” Trump’s involvement was superficial, and intended only to allow him to make the facetious claim that he had “brokered” the deal. Trump reportedly offered both sides some relief from punitive US trade tariffs he had imposed on both earlier in the year as an incentive to sign, a pledge that in no way addressed the issues of concern between the two, and which no one expects him to honor, anyway.
        </p>

        <p>
            The next step in the easing of tensions was supposed to be the release of 18 Cambodian soldiers held in Thailand, but that has apparently been delayed by this latest flare-up. The Cambodian government has said it remains committed to the deal, but on Monday Thai Prime Minister Anutin Charnvirakul said that he agreed with the recommendation of the military to suspend the peace agreement, saying the “security threat has not actually decreased.”
        </p>

        <p>
            Asean has had a rather poor record of resolving conflicts among its member-states, among them decades of unrest in Myanmar, the longstanding dispute between Malaysia and the Philippines over the latter’s claims to Sabah, and conflicting claims in the South China Sea. The current crisis between Thailand and Cambodia may offer an opportunity to make some progress in this regard, and the Philippines as the new Asean chair can and should lead the effort.
        </p>

        <p>
        It is ideally positioned to do so. Besides the bit of authority as Asean chair, the Philippines has excellent relations with both Thailand and Cambodia, and no significant bilateral issues of disagreement with either one. It can provide a safe neutral venue for both sides to hold discussions, and can serve as a completely neutral moderator, having no cultural or political interest in the issues affecting the two. Similarly, the Philippines can provide skilled and capable military personnel to form a peacekeeping force, or as the original agreement described it, “interim observer team,” although other Asean members will also participate in this.        
        </p>
        
        <p>
        Taking the initiative to offer this assistance to Cambodia and Thailand to help calm their tensions and keep the long-running dispute between the two countries from flaring up into violence again would be a positive step, not only for the Philippines, but for the Asean community at large. It would signal to the rest of the world that we in the region are quite willing and able to address intraregional concerns without the patronizing, and in this case, unasked for intercession of outside powers with ulterior motives. The engagement of the Philippines and other Asean members with Thailand and Cambodia is not likely to completely solve their contested border dispute entirely, but it can help to establish and maintain peace, setting a good precedent for addressing other conflicts.
