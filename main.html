        <h3>Marcos vows flood control cheats in jail by December</h3>
        <p class="subheadline">“No Merry Christmas for the shameless”</p>

        <p>
            (UPDATE) PRESIDENT Ferdinand Marcos Jr. on Thursday said many of those linked to the flood control 
            bribery scandal would be in jail by December — but his cousin, former speaker Martin Romualdez, 
            would not be one of them.
        </p>

        <p>
            “I know that before Christmas, many of those named here will have their cases concluded. They will 
            be in jail,” Marcos said, referring to former officials, lawmakers and contractors recommended for 
            charges by the Independent Commission for Infrastructure (ICI).

        </p>

        <h4>Who are involved?</h4>

        <p>
            The ICI’s first batch of case referrals involves 37 people, including Senators Joel Villanueva and 
            Jinggoy Estrada, former House appropriations chairman Elizaldy “Zaldy” Co, former Caloocan 
            representative Mitch Cajayon-Uy, COA Commissioner Mario Lipana, and former Public Works secretary 
            Manuel Bonoan.
        </p>

        <p>
            Also implicated were former DPWH undersecretaries Roberto Bernardo and Maria Catalina Cabral, DPWH 
            officials from Bulacan and Region 4B, and private contractor representatives. They face charges for 
            violating the Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act and malversation of public funds.
        </p>

        <h4>“There will be no merry Christmas for any of them”</h4>

        <p>
            Marcos emphasized accountability, recovery of stolen funds, and reforms to stop irregularities. 
            He stressed that strong evidence is needed to avoid technical dismissals.
        </p>

        <p class="quote">
            “We make sure that when we file a case, that case will be strong until the end.”
        </p>

        <h4>Romualdez not on the list</h4>

        <p>
            Marcos confirmed that Romualdez is not among the 37 individuals referred for charges, though 
            further evidence may still lead to accountability.
        </p>

        <h4>Anti-corruption drive continues</h4>

        <p>
            The administration’s campaign will not stop at the first batch of names. Marcos reiterated no one 
            is immune from investigation. Over 20,000 reports have been filed via “Sumbong sa Pangulo.”
        </p>

        <p>
            The ICI also filed an interim report on a P74-million flood control project in Bulacan where no 
            actual structure was built despite full payment to the contractor.
        </p>

        <h4>Duterte: “He should jail himself”</h4>

        <p>
            Vice President Sara Duterte criticized Marcos, saying he should hold himself accountable for 
            shortcomings that contributed to severe flooding caused by faulty projects.
