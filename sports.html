            MAGNOLIA tries to get back on the winning track when it battles fast-fading Blackwater on Friday in the 
            PBA Season 50 Philippine Cup at the Smart Araneta Coliseum in Quezon City.
        </p>

        <p>
            The Hotshots are coming off a heartbreaking 94-92 loss to the San Miguel Beermen last week, but will try 
            to erase the bitter taste of that defeat against the Bossing.
        </p>

        <p class="highlight-time"><strong>Game time is 5:15 p.m.</strong></p>

        <p>
            <strong>REDEMPTION TIME</strong> — Chris Koon and the Magnolia Hotshots try to bounce back from a 
            92-94 loss to San Miguel Beer last Friday when they take on the Blackwater Bossing on Nov. 14, 2024.
        </p>

        <p>
            Magnolia enters the match tied at fifth place with Converge at 4-2. A win today will be big for rookie 
            coach LA Tenorio’s squad as the Hotshots are eyeing a top 4 finish heading into the quarterfinals.
        </p>

        <p>
            Blackwater, meanwhile, is in danger of missing the playoffs after losing five straight games since their 
            season-opening win against Terrafirma.
        </p>

        <h4>Second Game: Ginebra vs Converge (7:30 p.m.)</h4>

        <p>
            Barangay Ginebra looks to build on its 30-point demolition of NLEX. Their previous game was postponed 
            due to Super Typhoon Uwan.
        </p>

        <p>
            Ginebra holds a 2-3 record after losses to top teams such as Magnolia, Meralco, and SMB. Converge aims 
            to break into the top 4 led by Justin Araña, Justine Baltazar, Alec Stockton, Schonny Winston, and 
            rookie Juan Gomez de Liano.
        </p>

            possession,” — Coach Delta Pineda
