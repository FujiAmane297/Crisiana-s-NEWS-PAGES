        <h3>Our leaders are irredeemably insensitive</h3>

<p>AS though the Filipino public needed something else to be angry about, a new source of discontent has been found in the reports of several Cebu politicians being away from their posts on a foreign junket at the height of Typhoon Tino. Likewise, first lady Liza Araneta-Marcos came under fire this week for hosting an event in Malacañang as Typhoon Uwan was hitting the north of the country. They all have been quick to offer excuses for their actions, but even if these were valid, they completely miss the point, which only suggests that our political class in general is incapable of being left to their own cognizance to demonstrate situational awareness and sensitivity.</p>


<p>As widely reported, and is fueling a great deal of public outrage among netizens, Cebu 5th District Rep. Vincent “Duke” Frasco, along with Liloan Mayor Aljew Fernando Frasco, Catmon Mayor Avis Ginoo-Monleon, San Francisco Mayor Alfredo Arquillano Jr., Tudela Mayor Greman Solante, Poro Mayor Edgar Rama, Pilar Mayor Manuel Santiago and Compostela Mayor Felijur Quiño, were all in London when Tino struck the Visayas, doing most of its damage in Cebu province. The purpose of the trip, which many have come to regard as a thinly disguised junket, was to attend the World Travel Market from Nov. 1 to 7.</p>


<p>As a result of these officials’ absence during the catastrophe, the Department of the Interior and Local Government has begun an investigation; an attorney in Cebu has filed a complaint against the mayors and Frasco with the Office of the Ombudsman for the Visayas. In their defense, the officials have pointed out that their travel was properly approved well in advance — in fact, apparently even before the Sept. 30 earthquake that caused widespread damage in northern Cebu — which Cebu Gov. Pamela Baricuatro has confirmed. In Frasco’s case, his travel, which was at his own expense, was cleared by the speaker of the House through the secretary-general. Had a calamity not occurred, there would have been nothing to suggest the travel was improper in any way, and in fact, probably would not have attracted any public attention at all.</p>


<p>To be fair, Frasco, as soon as he arrived in London on Nov. 4, immediately returned to the Philippines. That should probably excuse him from any serious repercussions, except perhaps a stern admonition to pay closer attention to weather forecasts the next time. As for the others, the excuse that the travel was “properly authorized” is weak and inconsiderate of the plight of their constituents. It must be said that Governor Baricuatro should share some of the blame as well. Even if it was not within her power to cancel travel authorizations once they were given, she could have at least urged the mayors to do the right thing and remain home, or do what Frasco did and return at once if they were already en route. Her responses to questions about the travel authorizations are only a little less insensitive than the mayors’ absence; the travel clearance was according to procedure, she said, and so the matter is otherwise out of her hands.</p>


<p>That the mayors had plenty of opportunity to avoid leaving their constituents in a crisis is clear. As early as Nov. 1, weather forecasts showed the storm’s expected track crossing Cebu, and by the next day, the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration was beginning to issue storm signals. One official scheduled to take the London trip, Borbon Mayor Nico Dotillos, put his priorities in the right order and canceled his travel plans.</p>


<p>The latest incidents are not the only time political personalities have been caught out acting with apparent lack of concern for ordinary people being affected by calamities. Even something as well-meaning and ultimately harmless as the first lady’s hosting of a civic event during Typhoon Uwan is extremely poor optics for the public. A family sheltering in a crowded, noisy evacuation center while the rains pour down and the wind howls is not going to be enervated by the holding of a formal reception meant “to promote and recognize the talents of our people,” as Palace spokesman Claire Castro awkwardly put it. That sort of thing can wait until the storm passes and people are out of harm’s way.</p>


<p>One would think that normally intelligent adults in positions of authority would know how to act without being told, but it seems that might be an overestimation. In the case of local government officials, perhaps more specific rules need to be put in place.</p>
