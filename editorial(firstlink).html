        <h3>Flawed DPWH policy idled critical heavy equipment</h3>
        <p class="editorial-meta">
            The Editorial Board <br>
            November 14, 2025
        </p>

        <p>
            THERE is something terribly amiss when heavy equipment acquired by the Department of Public Works and 
            Highways (DPWH) in 2018 were not deployed during the string of natural calamities that struck the country 
            recently, just because they were “reserved” for a potentially catastrophic earthquake that could devastate 
            Metro Manila. 
        </p>

        <p>
            President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. himself was surprised by this serious oversight after being told that the 
            equipment had lain idle at the DPWH stockyards.
        </p>

        <p>
            The 150 machines were purchased by the DPWH through a World Bank loan as part of preparations for the 
            “Big One” — a magnitude 7.2 quake that could level most of Metro Manila and kill as many as 50,000 persons.
        </p>

        <p>
            Geophysicists have long warned that the West Valley Fault is ripe for a major quake. The 2014 JICA study 
            projected at least 34,000 deaths from building collapse and another 20,000 from fires.
        </p>

        <p>
            In response, the government strengthened the Building Code and improved earthquake readiness measures.
        </p>

        <p>
            In 2013, the DPWH created an “Equipment Pre-positioning and Mobilization Contingency Plan” that clustered 
            heavy equipment near Metro Manila to provide support for the four designated quadrants during the Big One.
        </p>

        <p>
            However, the plan stated that the equipment must remain on standby unless an actual massive earthquake 
            occurs. This resulted in the assets being untouched for years.
        </p>

        <p class="highlight">
            President Marcos was appalled. “They said it was reserved for the Big One. But I think we’ve already 
            experienced the Big One when it comes to flooding,” he said in Filipino.
        </p>

        <p>
            Torillo Noel Ilao, head of the DPWH equipment bureau, explained the machines were reserved exclusively for 
            debris clearing and rescue operations after a major quake.
        </p>

        <p>
            The president has now ordered the immediate deployment of the equipment for clearing waterways across 
            Greater Metro Manila — a critical move as the metropolis faces worsening flooding every year.
        </p>

        <p>
            Because of climate change, heavy rainfall has intensified flood risks. Japan, through JICA, continues to 
            support large-scale flood mitigation projects like the Pasig-Marikina River Channel Improvement Project.
        </p>

        <p>
            The Manggahan Floodway, though originally effective, now suffers from informal settlements and poor waste 
            management that clog waterways and pumping stations.
        </p>

        <p>
            The 2017 Metro Manila Flood Management Master Plan aimed to rehabilitate pumping stations and relocate 
            informal settlers, yet progress remains far behind targets. The World Bank criticized the failure to remove 
            104,000 settlers in high-risk zones.
        </p>

        <p>
            Recently, the president declared that the heavy equipment previously reserved for the Big One will be 
            officially reassigned to the cleanup and rehabilitation of Metro Manila esteros, spillways, and pumping 
            stations.
        </p>

        <p class="closing">
            Already battered by corruption issues, the DPWH now faces further scrutiny for policies that prevent it 
            from executing the president’s directive to focus on “life-changing infrastructure projects.”
